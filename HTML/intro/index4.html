    <!-- 
        If you want the background image to cover the entire element, 
        you can set the background-size property to cover.

        Also, to make sure the entire element is always covered, 
        set the background-attachment property to fixed:

        This way, the background image will cover the entire element, 
        with no stretching (the image will keep its original proportions):
    -->

    <!-- set the bg size to 100% 100% if u want it to stretched -->


    <!-- background image of an html element -->
    <p style="background-image: url(img1.png); color: white;">
        This parag has a bg image</p>
    <!-- u can also use on body tag -->

    <!-- 
        If the background image is smaller than the element, 
        the image will repeat itself, 
        horizontally and vertically, 
        until it reaches the end of the element:
    -->
