    <!--block-level elem = always starts on a new line, 
        and the browsers automatically add some space (a margin) 
        before and after the element.
        
        A block-level element always takes up the full width available 
        (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).
    
        ex : p and div tags
    -->

    <p>Hello, World</p>
    <div>World, Hello</div>

    <!--
        an inline element does not start on a new line,
        it only takes up as much width as necessary
        
        ex: span tags
    -->
    <span>Hello, World</span>
